Let $S = K[x_1,\ldots, x_n]$, let $M$ , $N$ be ﬁnitely generated graded $S$-modules, and let $\mm =(x_1,\ldots, x_n)\subseteq S$. We give bounds for the regularity of the local cohomology of $\Tor_k (M, N)$ in terms
of the graded Betti numbers of $M$ and $N$, under the assumption that $\dim\Tor_1 (M, N)\leq 1$. We apply
the results to syzygies, products and powers of ideals. For example we show that any homogeneous linearly presented
$\mm$-primary ideal has some power equal to a power of $\mm$; and if the ﬁrst $\upbraket{(n-1)/2}$ steps of the
resolution of $I$ are linear, then $I^2$ is a power of $\mm$.
